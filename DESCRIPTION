Description: shinyStorage allows you to store data locally in the browser
    within your shiny apps. It is an R wrapper for simpleStorage. simpleStorage
    is a fork of jStorage that only includes the minimal set of features.
    Basically it is a wrapper for native JSON + localStorage with some TTL
    magic mixed in.
