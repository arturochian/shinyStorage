shinyStorage
============

shinyStorage allows you to store data locally in the browser
within your shiny apps. It is an R wrapper for simpleStorage. simpleStorage
is a fork of jStorage that only includes the minimal set of features.
Basically it is a wrapper for native JSON + localStorage with some TTL
magic mixed in.
